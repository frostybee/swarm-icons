title: Updating Icon Sets
description: Check for and apply updates to downloaded JSON icon sets from npm.
---

The `json:update` command checks npm for newer versions of your downloaded JSON icon sets and updates them in place. It compares the version stored in your `swarm-icons.json` manifest against the latest release on npm.

## Quick start

```bash
# Check what's outdated without downloading anything
php vendor/bin/swarm-icons json:update --dry-run

# Update everything
php vendor/bin/swarm-icons json:update

# Update specific sets only
php vendor/bin/swarm-icons json:update mdi tabler
```

## How it works

1. The command reads your `swarm-icons.json` manifest to find which sets are installed and what version each one was downloaded at.
2. For each set, it queries the npm registry for the latest version of `@iconify-json/{prefix}`.
3. It displays a comparison table so you can see what changed.
4. Unless `--dry-run` is set, it downloads and replaces any outdated JSON files and records the new versions in the manifest.

## Version table

The output shows a table with the status of each set:

```
 ---------- --------- --------- ------------------
  Prefix     Current   Latest    Status
 ---------- --------- --------- ------------------
  mdi        7.4.47    7.5.0     update available
  tabler     3.31.0    3.31.0    up to date
  heroicons  unknown   2.2.0     unknown version
 ---------- --------- --------- ------------------
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **up to date** | Installed version matches the latest npm release |
| **update available** | A newer version exists on npm |
| **unknown version** | The set was downloaded before version tracking was added; it will be re-downloaded to record its version |
| **fetch failed** | The npm registry could not be reached for this set |

## Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--dry-run` | | Show the version table without downloading | `false` |
| `--dest` | `-d` | JSON files directory | auto-detected |

## Version tracking

Version tracking is built into the `swarm-icons.json` manifest. When you download sets with `json:download` or update them with `json:update`, each set's npm version is stored alongside the prefix list:

```json
{
    "json-sets": ["mdi", "tabler"],
    "versions": {
        "mdi": "7.4.47",
        "tabler": "3.31.0"
    }
}
```

The `versions` key is optional. Old manifests that only contain `json-sets` still work; `json:update` will treat those sets as having an unknown version and offer to re-download them.

## Automation

You can add update checks to your CI pipeline or a Composer script:

```json
"scripts": {
    "icons:update": "swarm-icons json:update"
}
```

Then run `composer icons:update` to keep your icon sets current.

:::tip
Use `--dry-run` in CI to detect outdated sets without modifying files. The command exits with status 0 regardless of whether updates are available, so pair it with output parsing if you want to fail the build on stale icons.
