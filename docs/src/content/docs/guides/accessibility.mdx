description: How Swarm Icons handles ARIA attributes automatically and best practices for accessible icon usage.
---

Swarm Icons handles the most common accessibility patterns for you. Most of the time, you don't need to think about it. The defaults do the right thing.

## The two kinds of icons

Every icon on a page is either **decorative** or **meaningful**:

- **Decorative** icons sit next to text that already explains what's going on. A trash can icon next to the word "Delete": the icon is decoration, the text carries the meaning.
- **Meaningful** icons stand alone as the only way to understand an action. A trash can icon with no text: screen readers need to know what it does.

Swarm Icons detects which case you're in and adds the right ARIA attributes automatically.

## Decorative icons (the default)

If you don't pass `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`, the icon is treated as decorative and hidden from screen readers:

```php
echo swarm_icon('tabler:home');
// → <svg aria-hidden="true" ...>...</svg>
```

This is the right behavior for the majority of icons (the ones that sit next to visible text):

```php
echo swarm_icon('tabler:home') . ' Home';
echo '<button>' . swarm_icon('tabler:trash') . ' Delete</button>';
echo '<a href="/">' . swarm_icon('tabler:home') . ' Dashboard</a>';
```

In all of these, the text does the communicating. The icon is visual reinforcement.

## Meaningful icons

When an icon is the **only** indicator of what something does, give it an `aria-label`. Swarm Icons will add `role="img"` automatically:

```php
echo swarm_icon('tabler:home', ['aria-label' => 'Home']);
// → <svg role="img" aria-label="Home" ...>...</svg>
```

This matters most for icon-only controls:

```php
// Icon-only button
echo '<button>' . swarm_icon('tabler:trash', ['aria-label' => 'Delete item']) . '</button>';

// Icon-only link
echo '<a href="/settings">' . swarm_icon('tabler:settings', ['aria-label' => 'Settings']) . '</a>';
```

Without `aria-label`, a screen reader user wouldn't know what these controls do.

You can also use `aria-labelledby` to reference another element on the page:

```php
echo '<h2 id="section-title">Dashboard</h2>';
echo swarm_icon('tabler:layout-dashboard', ['aria-labelledby' => 'section-title']);
```

## Overriding the defaults

If you set `aria-hidden` or `role` yourself, Swarm Icons won't touch them:

```php
echo swarm_icon('tabler:home', ['role' => 'presentation']);
echo swarm_icon('tabler:home', ['aria-hidden' => 'true', 'aria-label' => 'Home']);
```

The automatic behavior only kicks in when those attributes aren't already present.

## Practical guidelines

**Let most icons be decorative.** If there's text next to it, the icon doesn't need a label. This is the default. You don't need to do anything.

**Label icon-only controls.** Any button, link, or input that has no visible text needs `aria-label`:

```php
echo '<button>' . swarm_icon('tabler:x', ['aria-label' => 'Close']) . '</button>';
```

**Don't double up.** If the text already says "Delete", don't also label the icon "Delete": a screen reader would announce it twice:

```php
// Good: icon is decorative, text carries the meaning
echo swarm_icon('tabler:trash') . ' Delete';

// Avoid: screen reader says "Delete Delete"
echo swarm_icon('tabler:trash', ['aria-label' => 'Delete']) . ' Delete';
```

## In Twig

The same rules apply: the rendering pipeline is identical:

```twig
{# Decorative #}
{{ icon('tabler:home') }} Home

{# Meaningful #}
{{ icon('tabler:home', {'aria-label': 'Go to homepage'}) }}
```
