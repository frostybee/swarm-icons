These features aren't needed for every project, but they're useful as your icon usage grows, especially when working with dynamic icon names, large teams, or third-party packages.

## Aliases

If you find yourself typing `heroicons:check-circle` over and over, give it a shorter name:

```php
->alias('check', 'heroicons:check-circle')
->alias('dots',  'clarity:ellipsis-horizontal-line')
->alias('close', 'heroicons:x-mark')
```

Now you can use the alias anywhere you'd use the full name:

```php
echo swarm_icon('check');
echo swarm_icon('close', ['class' => 'w-4 h-4']);
$manager->has('dots'); // true
```

Aliases are resolved before prefix parsing, so they work transparently with `get()`, `has()`, and the `swarm_icon()` helper.

A few things to keep in mind:
- The target must be a full `prefix:name` string
- Only one level of indirection: you can't alias to another alias
- Calling `->alias()` twice with the same key overwrites the first mapping

You can inspect what's registered at runtime with `$manager->getAliases()`.

## Fallback icon

When a requested icon doesn't exist, Swarm Icons throws `IconNotFoundException` by default. If you'd rather show a placeholder, set a fallback:

```php
->fallbackIcon('heroicons:question-mark-circle')
```

Pick something from a set you know is always available (a downloaded JSON set or a local directory that ships with your project).

## Suppressing exceptions with `ignoreNotFound`

For cases where you'd rather render nothing than throw, enable `ignoreNotFound`:

```php
->ignoreNotFound()
```

Missing icons will return an empty `Icon` that renders as an empty string. No exception, no visible output.

:::note
`InvalidIconNameException` (bad format like an empty string) is always thrown regardless of this setting. Only `IconNotFoundException` is suppressed.
:::

## The two-layer safety net

`fallbackIcon` and `ignoreNotFound` work well together. The fallback is tried first: if it also fails, `ignoreNotFound` catches it silently:

```php
->fallbackIcon('tabler:question-mark')
->ignoreNotFound()
```

```php
echo swarm_icon('tabler:nonexistent');
// 1. Icon not found → tries fallback 'tabler:question-mark'
// 2. Fallback found → renders the question mark icon
```

If the fallback itself were also missing (unlikely, but possible), the icon would render as an empty string instead of throwing. This gives you a visible placeholder in normal cases and a silent fallback for edge cases.

In templates, this means you never need try/catch:

```php
echo swarm_icon('might-not-exist');
// Either the fallback icon, or '': never an exception
```

## Package discovery

If you're building a Composer package that provides icons, you can make it auto-discoverable. Declare your provider in `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "swarm-icons": {
            "prefix": "myset",
            "provider-class": "Vendor\\MyIconSet"
        }
    }
}
```

The provider class implements `IconSetInterface`:

```php
use Frostybee\SwarmIcons\IconSetInterface;
use Frostybee\SwarmIcons\IconManager;

class MyIconSet implements IconSetInterface
{
    public static function prefix(): string
    {
        return 'myset';
    }

    public static function register(IconManager $manager): void
    {
        $manager->register('myset', new DirectoryProvider(__DIR__ . '/icons'));
    }
}
```

Consumers of your package just add one line to their config:

```php
->discoverPackages()
```

Both single-set (object) and multi-set (array) formats are supported in the `extra.swarm-icons` field.
