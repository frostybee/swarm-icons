description: Guidelines for contributing to Swarm Icons.
---

Contributions are welcome! Here's how to get started.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frostybee/swarm-icons.git
cd swarm-icons
composer install
```

## Before Submitting a PR

Run the full check suite and make sure everything passes:

```bash
composer test-all
```

This runs PHPStan (level 8), CS check (PER-CS2.0), and PHPUnit in sequence.

## Code Conventions

- `declare(strict_types=1)` in every PHP file
- Strict typing throughout . no `mixed` return types unless unavoidable
- Alpha-sorted `use` imports
- Test methods named `test_snake_case_description()` in classes extending `PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase`
- Test fixtures (SVG files) in `tests/Fixtures/icons/`

## Architecture Notes

- **Provider pattern** is the core abstraction . implement `IconProviderInterface` to add a new source
- **Icon** is an immutable value object . all fluent methods must return a new instance
- **SwarmIconsConfig** is a fluent builder . every new option needs a corresponding builder method
- **SvgParser** handles sanitization . XSS-related changes go here
- **Single production dependency**: `psr/simple-cache: ^3.0` only. Framework integrations are `require-dev`
