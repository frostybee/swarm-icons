title: Why Swarm Icons?
description: When Swarm Icons makes sense, and when plain SVG is fine.

If you have 3 icons, just paste the SVG. Seriously.

Swarm Icons exists for when that approach stops scaling: when you're managing dozens of icons across a PHP application and want them to stay consistent, accessible, and easy to change.

## Swarm Icons vs. plain SVG

| Scenario | Plain SVG | Swarm Icons |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 5 icons in a static site | Better, no overhead | Overkill |
| 50+ icons across a PHP app | Gets messy fast | Clean `swarm_icon('tabler:home')` |
| Consistent sizing and stroke | Manual on every `<svg>` tag | `defaultAttributes()` once |
| Switching icon sets | Find & replace everything | Change one prefix |
| Iconify API fallback | Not possible | Built-in |
| Twig templates | Inline SVG blobs | `{{ icon('tabler:home') }}` |
| Accessibility | Manual `aria-hidden` on every icon | Automatic |
| Caching | Not applicable | PSR-16 file cache |

## When it makes sense

You'll get the most value from Swarm Icons when your project has some combination of these:

- **Many icons** spread across multiple templates, not just a few in one place
- **Consistency requirements**: every icon should be the same size, same stroke width, same base class, without repeating yourself
- **Multiple icon sets**: mixing Tabler, Heroicons, and custom SVGs under one API
- **Template engines**: Twig's `{{ icon() }}` or Blade's `{!! swarm_icon() !!}` beat pasting raw SVG
- **Accessibility needs**: `aria-hidden` and `role="img"` applied automatically based on context
- **Offline + API flexibility**: pre-download JSON sets for production, fall back to the Iconify API during development

## When plain SVG is fine

- A small static site with a handful of icons
- No PHP templating involved
- Icons are baked in and never change
- You don't need consistency across multiple templates

There's nothing wrong with copy-pasting SVGs. Swarm Icons doesn't try to replace that for simple use cases: it picks up where that approach starts to hurt.
