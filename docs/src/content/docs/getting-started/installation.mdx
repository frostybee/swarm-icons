**Swarm Icons** is a framework-agnostic PHP library for rendering SVG icons from local files, pre-downloaded JSON collections, or the live Iconify API, with a single, consistent interface.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- `psr/simple-cache: ^3.0`

## Install via Composer

```bash
composer require frostybee/swarm-icons
```

## Download Icon Sets

After installing, download the icon sets you want to use. No Node.js required: the CLI fetches directly from the npm registry in pure PHP:

```bash
php vendor/bin/swarm-icons json:download mdi tabler heroicons
```

Downloaded sets are recorded in a `swarm-icons.json` manifest for easy restoration. See the [Icon Set Commands](/swarm-icons/cli/icon-sets/) for all options including `--all`, browsing available sets, and auto-restore via Composer scripts.
