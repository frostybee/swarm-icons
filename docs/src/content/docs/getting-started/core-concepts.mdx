description: Understand how Swarm Icons resolves icons through providers, names them with prefixes, and controls their appearance with layered attributes.

Before you go deep into configuration, it helps to understand a few ideas that shape how Swarm Icons works.

## Providers load your icons

A **provider** is a backend that knows how to fetch SVG data. You pick the right one depending on where your icons live:

- **`DirectoryProvider`** reads `.svg` files from a folder on disk.
- **`JsonCollectionProvider`** reads pre-downloaded Iconify JSON files: fast, offline, recommended for production.
- **`IconifyProvider`** fetches icons on demand from the Iconify HTTP API.
- **`ChainProvider`** tries multiple providers in order until one finds the icon: great for local overrides with an API fallback.

You can mix and match. A typical setup might use JSON collections for your main sets, a directory for custom brand icons, and the API as a safety net.

## Prefixes keep things organized

Every provider is registered under a **prefix**: a short string you choose. When you request an icon, you write `prefix:name`:

```php
echo swarm_icon('tabler:home');
echo swarm_icon('mdi:account');
echo swarm_icon('custom:logo');
```

The prefix tells Swarm Icons *which provider* to ask. The name tells that provider *which icon* to return.

If you set a default prefix, you can skip it for your most-used set:

```php
->defaultPrefix('tabler')

echo swarm_icon('home');         // resolves to tabler:home
echo swarm_icon('mdi:account');  // other sets still need the prefix
```

## Icons are value objects

When you call `swarm_icon()`, you get back an `Icon` object. It's immutable and `Stringable`: you can echo it directly and get a full `<svg>` tag:

```php
echo swarm_icon('tabler:home');
// <svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" ...>...</svg>
```

Every fluent method returns a **new instance**, so the original stays unchanged:

```php
$home = swarm_icon('tabler:home');

echo $home->size(32);                // width="32" height="32"
echo $home->class('text-blue-500');  // adds the class
echo $home;                          // still the original, untouched
```

## Attributes flow through layers

Instead of passing the same `class`, `stroke-width`, or `fill` to every icon call, you set defaults once. Swarm Icons merges attributes in layers: each one can add or override what came before:

1. **Icon defaults**: whatever the SVG file already has (`viewBox`, `xmlns`, etc.)
2. **Global defaults**: applied to every icon you render
3. **Prefix defaults**: applied to icons from a specific set
4. **Suffix defaults**: applied based on the icon name's ending (e.g., `-solid`, `-outline`)
5. **Caller attributes**: what you pass in the `swarm_icon()` call

The last layer always wins. But CSS classes are special: they **accumulate** instead of replacing:

```php
// You configured: defaultAttributes(['class' => 'icon'])
// You configured: prefixAttributes('tabler', ['class' => 'w-6 h-6'])

echo swarm_icon('tabler:home', ['class' => 'text-blue']);
// class="icon w-6 h-6 text-blue": all three are present
```

This means you can set a base size for all Tabler icons, a shared `.icon` class globally, and still add per-instance classes without losing anything.

## SVG content is sanitized

Every SVG that passes through Swarm Icons is cleaned automatically. The parser strips `<script>` tags, `on*` event handlers, `javascript:` URIs, and external resource references. You don't need to worry about XSS from untrusted SVG files.

## Icons are cached

Providers that do expensive work (parsing JSON files, making HTTP requests) cache individual icons via PSR-16. The built-in file cache stores icons on disk with no expiration by default, so the heavy lifting only happens once.

```php
->cachePath(__DIR__ . '/cache/icons')
```

If you don't configure a cache, Swarm Icons uses the system temp directory automatically.

## Accessibility is automatic

Decorative icons (most of them) get `aria-hidden="true"` added automatically. When you pass `aria-label`, the icon becomes meaningful and gets `role="img"` instead:

```php
echo swarm_icon('home');
// → aria-hidden="true" (decorative: hidden from screen readers)

echo swarm_icon('home', ['aria-label' => 'Home']);
// → role="img" aria-label="Home" (meaningful: announced to screen readers)
```

You don't have to think about this unless you want to. The defaults do the right thing.
