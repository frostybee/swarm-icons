import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You've installed the package. Now let's get an icon on screen.

<Steps>

1. **Download your first icon set**

   Swarm Icons ships with a CLI that pulls icon sets straight from npm: no Node.js needed. Grab [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons) to start:

   ```bash
   php vendor/bin/swarm-icons json:download tabler
   ```

   This saves the full Tabler set as a JSON file in `resources/json/`. You can download as many sets as you want: Material Design Icons, Heroicons, Lucide, and [200+ others](/swarm-icons/cli/icon-sets/) are all available.

2. **Wire it up**

   Create a small bootstrap file (or add this to your existing one):

   ```php
   use Frostybee\SwarmIcons\SwarmIcons;
   use Frostybee\SwarmIcons\SwarmIconsConfig;

   $manager = SwarmIconsConfig::create()
       ->discoverJsonSets()
       ->cachePath(__DIR__ . '/cache/icons')
       ->defaultPrefix('tabler')
       ->build();

   SwarmIcons::setManager($manager);
   ```

   That's the entire setup. `discoverJsonSets()` finds every JSON file you've downloaded and makes it available. `defaultPrefix('tabler')` means you can write `'home'` instead of `'tabler:home'` for your most-used set.

   :::note
   `discoverJsonSets()` scans `resources/json/` by default. Pass a path to change it: `discoverJsonSets('/custom/path')`.
   :::

3. **Render an icon**

   Now, anywhere in your app:

   ```php
   echo swarm_icon('home');
   ```

   That's it. You'll get a clean `<svg>` tag with `aria-hidden="true"` applied automatically.

   Want to customize it? Chain fluent methods: each one returns a new immutable icon:

   ```php
   echo swarm_icon('home')->size(32)->class('text-blue-500');
   ```

   :::tip[Shorthand alias]
   Prefer something shorter? Use `sicon()`, an alias for `swarm_icon()`:
   ```php
   echo sicon('home')->size(32)->class('text-blue-500');
   ```
   :::

</Steps>

## Add more sets

Need icons from different sets? Download them and reference by prefix:

```bash
php vendor/bin/swarm-icons json:download mdi heroicons
```

```php
echo swarm_icon('home');                  // tabler (your default)
echo swarm_icon('mdi:account');           // Material Design
echo swarm_icon('heroicons:check-circle'); // Heroicons
```

Every set gets its own prefix. No conflicts, no ambiguity.

## Other ways to load icons

JSON collections are the recommended path, but you have options.

**Your own SVG files**: point at a directory and go:

```php
->addDirectory('custom', __DIR__ . '/resources/icons')
```

**Live Iconify API**: zero setup, fetches icons over HTTP on first use:

```php
->addIconifySet('heroicons')
```

**Both at once**: local files first, API as fallback:

```php
->addHybridSet('icons', __DIR__ . '/my-icons')
```

Each approach is covered in detail in the [Providers](/swarm-icons/providers/local-svg/) section.

## Next steps

Now that you have icons rendering, you might want to:

- **Understand the architecture**: [Core Concepts](/swarm-icons/getting-started/core-concepts/) explains providers, prefixes, and how attributes flow through the system.
- **Fine-tune your setup**: The [Configuration Builder](/swarm-icons/configuration/builder/) covers caching, default attributes, aliases, and more.
- **Explore the CLI**: [Browse and search](/swarm-icons/cli/icon-sets/) across 200+ icon sets to find exactly what you need.
