title: Using the Iconify API
description: Fetch icons on demand from the Iconify HTTP API with automatic caching and multi-host fallback.
---

Don't want to download anything? The Iconify API provider gives you access to 200,000+ icons across 200+ sets: just register a prefix and start rendering. Icons are fetched over HTTP on first use and cached locally from that point on.

## Getting started

```php
$manager = SwarmIconsConfig::create()
    ->addIconifySet('heroicons')
    ->addIconifySet('tabler')
    ->cachePath(__DIR__ . '/cache/icons')
    ->build();

echo $manager->get('heroicons:home');
echo $manager->get('tabler:star');
```

No downloads, no JSON files, no manifest. The tradeoff is that your app needs internet access the first time it encounters each icon.

## What happens on a request

The first time you render an icon, the provider checks the cache. On a miss, it makes a single HTTP request to the Iconify API, builds the `Icon` object, stores it in cache, and returns it. Every request after that resolves from disk:

```
swarm_icon('heroicons:home')
  → cache hit?  → return immediately
  → cache miss? → GET api.iconify.design/heroicons.json?icons=home
                 → cache the result
                 → return SVG
```

The default TTL is `0`: cache forever. That means each icon is fetched exactly once, ever.

## Multi-host fallback

If the primary API host is down, the provider automatically tries two mirrors in sequence:

1. `https://api.iconify.design` (primary)
2. `https://api.simplesvg.com`
3. `https://api.unisvg.com`

You don't need to configure this: it happens transparently.

## Pre-warming the cache

If you'd rather avoid runtime HTTP entirely, you can pre-fetch icons during deployment. The `cache:warm` command batches everything into a single request:

```bash
vendor/bin/swarm-icons cache:warm --prefix=heroicons --icons=home,user,star,settings
```

You can also batch-fetch programmatically:

```php
$provider->fetchMany(['home', 'user', 'star', 'settings']);
```

After warming, those icons resolve from cache with zero latency.

## Tradeoffs

This provider is ideal for **prototyping and development**: you get instant access to any Iconify set with no setup. But there are limits to be aware of:

- The first request for each icon has HTTP latency
- Your app needs internet access (at least on first use, unless you pre-warm)
- `all()` returns an empty array: the API has no list endpoint

For production, [JSON Collections](/swarm-icons/providers/json-collections/) are usually the better fit. You can also combine both with a [Hybrid Provider](/swarm-icons/providers/hybrid/) (local files first, API as a safety net).
