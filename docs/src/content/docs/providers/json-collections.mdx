title: Using JSON Collections
description: Use pre-downloaded Iconify JSON collections for fast, offline icon rendering with no runtime HTTP.

This is the recommended way to use Iconify sets in production. You download the sets you need ahead of time, and Swarm Icons loads them from disk: no HTTP requests at runtime, no Node.js required.

## The workflow

<Steps>

1. **Download the sets you need**

   ```bash
   php vendor/bin/swarm-icons json:download mdi tabler heroicons
   ```

   This fetches each set as a JSON file into `resources/json/`. No Node.js required.

2. **Auto-discover and render**

   ```php
   $manager = SwarmIconsConfig::create()
       ->discoverJsonSets()
       ->cachePath(__DIR__ . '/cache/icons')
       ->build();

   echo swarm_icon('mdi:home');
   echo swarm_icon('tabler:star');
   echo swarm_icon('heroicons:check');
   ```

   `discoverJsonSets()` scans `resources/json/` for every `.json` file and registers it as a provider, using the filename as the prefix. One line covers all your downloaded sets.

</Steps>

## Finding sets to download

Over 200 Iconify icon sets are available. Browse them from the CLI:

```bash
php vendor/bin/swarm-icons json:browse
php vendor/bin/swarm-icons json:browse --search=emoji
```

Or download all 22 popular sets at once:

```bash
php vendor/bin/swarm-icons json:download --all
```

See [Icon Set Commands](/swarm-icons/cli/icon-sets/) for the full CLI reference.

## Keeping sets in sync

Downloaded sets are recorded in a `swarm-icons.json` manifest at your project root. Running `json:download` with no arguments re-downloads everything in the manifest (handy for CI/CD or restoring after a fresh clone).

:::tip
Add `json:download` to your Composer scripts so sets are restored automatically on `composer install` (useful for CI and fresh clones).
:::

To make this automatic, add Composer scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
    "post-install-cmd": ["swarm-icons json:download"],
    "post-update-cmd":  ["swarm-icons json:download"]
}
```

Think of it as `npm install @iconify-json/*`, but in pure PHP with a JSON manifest instead of `package.json`.

## Other ways to register

Auto-discovery is the easiest path, but you can also register sets individually.

**A specific JSON file:**

```php
->addJsonCollection('mdi', __DIR__ . '/resources/json/mdi.json')
```

**From the `iconify/json` Composer package** (if you've installed it via Composer):

```php
->addIconifyJsonSet('mdi')       // resolves vendor/iconify/json/json/mdi.json
->addIconifyJsonSet('tabler')
```

**A custom directory:**

```php
->discoverJsonSets('/custom/path/to/json')
```

## Under the hood

The JSON file isn't parsed upfront. It's **lazy-loaded** on the first `get()` call, and individual icons are cached via PSR-16 after that. Subsequent requests never touch the JSON file again.

Aliases defined in the Iconify JSON format are resolved transparently: if the MDI set defines `home-variant` as an alias for `home`, calling `swarm_icon('mdi:home-variant')` just works.

## When to use JSON vs. the Iconify API

| | JSON Collections | Iconify API |
|---|---|---|
| When icons are fetched | At deploy/setup time | At runtime, on first use |
| Works offline | Yes | No |
| What you get | The whole set at once | Only the icons you use |
| Setup | `json:download` + `discoverJsonSets()` | `addIconifySet()` |

For most apps, JSON collections are the better choice: icons load instantly with zero network overhead. The [Iconify API](/swarm-icons/providers/iconify-api/) is useful for prototyping or when you want access to every icon without downloading anything upfront.
